# A Dockerfile that generates the latest p2pdma .deb from inside a
# docker container. Since we do this inside docker we have a lot of
# control on which distro and tooling we use. Useful for testing and
# for when the distro you use does not support the
# build-latest-p2pdma-kernel script.
#
# Once this container build runs to completion you can use the docker
# copy command (docker cp) to copy the .deb files to the host and use
# dpkg -i to do the package install on your system. See the top-level
# README.md for more information.

  # Change this to your preferred distro.
